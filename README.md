# CodeCamp Notes

Lesson notes for LaunchCode's Immersive CodeCamp

## Value Error
when a function is expecting a certain type of parameter and you send it another type instead.


## Name Error 
almost always means using a variable before it has been assigned a value (uisng an identifier that hasn't been created yet).

Example: print(my_value)

## Parse Error 
is a type of syntax error. Usually means you left out punctuation, paren, etc.

Example: print("hello)

## Type Error
happens when you try to combine items that are incompatible (attempting to carry out an operation with incompatible type(s)).

## Syntax Error 
there is a line of code that python doesn't know what to do with (missing colon, indent, etc.).

## Semantic Error 
doesn't give you the outcome you want (logic error).

## Attribute Error
caused by using an object attribute that is not defined.

## Indentation Error
Not following Python's whitespace rules.

How to avoid bugs:
Work in small units*
using good names for things (semantics)*
